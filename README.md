# Blockchain_Based_Ledger
Utilizing streamlit to a create a blockchain based ledger system. The user has the option to input sender, receiver, and amount information. As well as check the specific entry, and validate the blockchain. 


## Technologies

This project leverages python3 with the following packages:

* [numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/) - For arrays and math.

* [streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started/installation) - For a blockchain interface. 

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) - For dataframs and csv reading.

* [hashlib](https://pypi.org/project/hashlib/) - Provides the hash algorithms. 

* [datetime](https://pypi.org/project/DateTime/) - For organizing timeseries data.  

* [dataclass](https://pypi.org/project/dataclasses/) - For the creation of data classes. 

* [typing](https://pypi.org/project/typing/) - Typing defines a standard notation for Python function and variable type annotations.
